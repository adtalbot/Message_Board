#MESSAGE BOARD

---

## Synopsis

MESSAGE BOARD was built by [Audrie Talbot](https://github.com/adtalbot). Crafted as part of the Spring 2015 JavaScript and Ember.js course curriculum at [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com/).

## Motivation

MESSAGE BOARD was created as an exercise in Ember.js app creation, especially with forms, database associations, library dependencies, and aesthetically-pleasing styles.

## Functionality

MESSAGE BOARD is a basic question and answer website where users can post questions and answers for others to answer.

## Installation

While MESSAGE BOARD is a simple web application and doesn't need to be _formally_ 'installed', in order to view directly from the source code, you must navigate to the project folder in the terminal, and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` (case sensitive) to fire up the server and view.
